# Machine Learning

Welcome to the Machine Learning repository! This repository contains Jupyter Notebook files related to various machine learning algorithms and techniques.

## About Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms and statistical models to enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. AI, on the other hand, is a broader field that encompasses the development of intelligent systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as problem-solving, pattern recognition, and decision-making.

Machine Learning algorithms can be broadly categorized into supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. These algorithms play a crucial role in numerous applications, including healthcare diagnostics, financial analysis, marketing optimization, and autonomous vehicles.
